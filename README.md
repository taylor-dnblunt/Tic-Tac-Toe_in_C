# Tic-Tac-Toe_in_C
My data structures and algorithm course final project was to make a tic-tac-toe game where you play against the computer, and the game can predict whether you are winning
or losing based on turns played and the layout of the board. The game was created using a binary tree structure to compute all possible boards and determine the best moves
the computer could play.

Some of the files required to build the game are missing because they were provided by the professor and I did not write them.
